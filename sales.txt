Hi my name is Andrew and I'm a software engineer
I'd like to talk to you about upgrading this form to an iPad app to:
shorten wait times and increase customer retention.

I've found some things wrong with your ordering process:
- It is difficult for the customer to see that they are only able to add one extra
- There is nothing preventing a customer to check multiple extra boxes
- No way to specify which menu items the special request or extras should apply to
- Sandwhiches makers have to hold customer form in one hand while preparing meal
